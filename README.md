# 1.0 BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
# Overview

Anemia is a major health issue among children aged 0-59 months in Nigeria, impairing growth, cognition, and immunity. It is driven by poor nutrition, frequent infections, and limited healthcare access, with socioeconomic factors like low income, limited education, and poor sanitation worsening its prevalence. Addressing anemia is vital for improving child health and supporting Nigeria's development.

# Problem Statement
Many children in Nigeria suffer from undetected and untreated anemia due to limited healthcare access, high diagnostic costs, and low public awareness. This project aims to develop a model that predicts anemia severity based on socioeconomic factors, enabling the identification of high-risk children and supporting targeted health interventions..

# Objectives
Develop a classification model for Anemia severity in children

Identify key socioeconomic determinants influencing Anemia severity

Evaluate the model’s predictive accuracy for effective Public Health Use

Provide Actionable Insights for Targeted Interventions

Support Long-Term Policy Development for Anemia Reduction

# Industry Domain
Healthcare and Public health.

# Model Implementation
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees.
Random Forest
KNN
Evaluation
The project's success was measured through:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 score
Confusion 

# Findings
Children in the Rural areas experience higher Anemia level than those living in urban areas due to limited acess to proper healthcare and sanitation.

Analysis of socio-economic determinants reveals that factors such as wealth index and parental education significantly influence anemia severity.

Different levels of Anemia are a result of the different hemoglobin levels. Chilren with lower hemoglobin level have higher level of Anemia and the reverse it true.

# Conclusions:
The project successfully developed a classification model using Python libraries that predicts anemia severity among children below 5 years.

The model achieved high predictive accuracy, validated through rigorous testing metrics, affirming its readiness for real-world application.

The project's findings and the model’s application in real-world settings contribute to policy development by offering reliable data that highlight social economic factors associated with anemia.

A user-friendly web application was developed as the project’s end-user interface. This application allows users to input data, leveraging the pickled model to make predictions and offer tailored recommendations.
